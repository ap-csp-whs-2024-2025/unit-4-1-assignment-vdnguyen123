## To compile code
All code must be compiled before you can run it.  To compile means that you are converting your C++ code into a language that the computer can understand (e.g., binary).  To compile C++ code, run the following command in a terminal:
```
g++ fileName.cpp -o outFileName
```
This tells the C++ compiler to compile your file named `fileName.cpp`, and output it (`-o`) as a file named `outFileName`.

## To run code
After you have compiled the code, run your output file by running
```
./outFileName
```

## Compile and Run Example
Suppose I have a file named `classwork.cpp`.  I compile and run the file by doing
```
g++ classwork.cpp -o output
./output
```

# C++ Variable and Operation Exercises
**Instructions:** For all exercises below, make variables to store the results and output them.  You are free to ask for user input for any problem.

## Exercise 1: Working with Integer and Double Types

1. **Create an `int` variable called `x` and initialize it to a value of 25.**  
   Create an `int` variable called `y` and initialize it to 3. 

2. **Perform the following operations and output the results:**
   - Add `x` and `y` together. What is the result?
   - Subtract `y` from `x`. Output the result.
   - Multiply `x` by `y`. Output the result.
   - Divide `x` by `y`. Output the result.
   - Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. Output the result.

3. **Create a new `int` variable `z` and initialize it to 10.**  
   Perform the following relational operations:
   - Is `x` greater than `z`? Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.
   - Is `y` less than `x`? Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.

## Exercise 2: Working with Boolean Variables

1. **Create two boolean variables**:  
   - `isSunny` and `hasUmbrella`.  
   Initialize `isSunny` to `true` and `hasUmbrella` to `false`.

2. **Perform the following boolean operations and output the results:**
   - Check if it is both sunny and you have an umbrella (`isSunny && hasUmbrella`).
   - Check if it is either sunny or you have an umbrella (`isSunny || hasUmbrella`).
   - Check if it is not sunny (`!isSunny`).
   - Check if it is not sunny and you don't have an umbrella (`!isSunny && !hasUmbrella`).
   - Output all results.

## Exercise 3: Mixing Relational and Boolean Logic

1. **Create three new variables:**
   - An `int` variable `n` initialized to 7.
   - A `double` variable `m` initialized to 4.0.
   - A `bool` variable `hasLicense` initialized to `false`.

2. **Perform the following operations and output the results:**
   - Check if `n` is greater than `m`. Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.
   - Check if `m` is equal to `4.0`. Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.
   - Check if both `hasLicense` is `true` and `m` is less than or equal to `n`. Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.
   - Use `&&` to check if both `n` is greater than `5` and `hasLicense` is `false`. Make a `bool` variable to store the result, and output the result.

## Exercise 4: String and Numeric Operations

1. **Create the following variables:**
   - A `std::string` variable `firstName` initialized to `"John"`.
   - A `std::string` variable `lastName` initialized to `"Doe"`.
   - A `double` variable `score` initialized to `85.75`.

2. **Perform the following operations and output the results:**
   - Print out the name of the person as `"Doe, John"`.
   - Print the message `"Your score is: "` with the `score` value and output the result.

## Exercise 6: Using Variables in a Real-World Scenario

1. **Create the following variables:**
   - An `int` variable `age` initialized to 18.
   - A `double` variable `height` initialized to 5.9 (representing height in feet).
   - A `bool` variable `isStudent` initialized to `true`.
   - A `std::string` variable `city` initialized to `"New York"`.

2. **Perform the following operations and output the results:**
   - Calculate the year you were born (assuming the current year is 2024) and output it.
   - Check if you are considered an adult (age >= 18) and output the result as `true` or `false`.
   - Calculate if your height is over 6 feet (height > 6). Output the result as `true` or `false`.
   - Use boolean operations to check if you are both a student and living in New York. Output the result as `true` or `false`.

## Bonus Challenge: Compound Expressions

1. **Create the following variables:**
   - An `int` variable `i` initialized to 50.
   - A `double` variable `d` initialized to 100.5.
   - A `bool` variable `flag` initialized to `false`.

2. **Perform the following compound expressions and output the results:**
   - Check if `i` is divisible by 5 **and** `d` is greater than 50. Output the result as `true` or `false`.
   - Check if `d` is less than or equal to 100 **or** `flag` is `true`. Output the result as `true` or `false`.
   - Check if the negation of `flag` is true **and** `i` is greater than 30. Output the result as `true` or `false`.
